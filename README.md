# MyPersonalProject: ExploreMeals

## About

This application serves as a handy and efficient way to explore different cuisines and prepare meals. 
This app allows people to view meals of different cuisines with its associated and ingredients.
People can select the meals they would like to make from their desired cuisine and have all the required ingredients delivered to them in one package. 
Not only does this app help *save time and money*, it also allows people to be *hands-on* with their own meal preparations. It is especially useful to those with busy schedules who hope to stop ordering out and make their own meals but do not have time to research recipes, ingredients, and browse grocery stores. 

As a full-time student, I believe this application is a great opportunity to develop the skills and good habits of not only making my own meals but also exploring different cuisines under the busy schedule of school.
