# MyPersonalProject: ExploreMeals

## About

This application serves as a handy and efficient way to explore different cuisines and prepare meals. 
Being able to view meals of different cuisines and their associated ingredients, people can select the meals they would like to make and add them to their personal wishlist. 
Not only does this app help *save time and money*, it also allows people to be *hands-on* with their meal preparations. It is especially useful to individuals with busy schedules who wishes to make their own meals but do not have time to research recipes, ingredients, and browse grocery stores. 

As a full-time student, I believe this application is a great opportunity to not only get rid of the bad habit of ordering out, but also develop my interest and skills in making my own meals under the busy schedule of school.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- Break down the MealGUI into smaller classes that handles different tasks, such as managing the main frame, masterlist frame, and wishlist frame to provide better readability
- Create helper methods for repetitive code like creating a button to reduce redundancy
- Create an abstract class or interface for the main menu, master wishlist, and personal wishlist panels since they share a lot of the same methods which can be outlined in one class
